# Fitness-Prediction-using-Supervised-Learning
Sports injuries are unpredictable and are unavoidable if it befalls someone. Sports injuries occur during exercise or while participating in a sport. Nearly 2 million people every year, many of whom are otherwise healthy, suffer sports-related injuries and receive treatment in emergency departments. Some sports-related injuries, such as sprained ankles, may be relatively minor, while others, such as head or neck injuries, can be quite serious. It is even common among sports players who are known to have a fit body and good physical fortitude, the reason being the excessive strain on the body due to overworking a particular muscle group or overstretching a particular muscle group. The main motive is to identify a player’s fitness based on very important and general day-to-day attributes that affect one’s lifestyle, where these attributes are very different from pure medical attributes. These data can be permuted and can be used for the identification of a sports injury that may happen in near future.

# INTRODUCTION:

The basic motive is to try to find out the core importance of data science/ML/AI and its  several other applications in the field of sports . This topic is comparatively untouched and not discovered upon , the current research on this topic is minute . In terms of development there is a lot that can be achieved if the true strengths of data science and its impact on sports is discovered.

1)The main motive is to identify a player’s fitness based on very important and general day-to-day attributes that affect one’s lifestyle, where these attributes are very different from pure medical attributes. These data can be permuted and can be used for the identification of a sports injury that may happen in near future.

2)Understand various real life examples of how DS/AI/ML/Sports analytics have actually benefitted the industry.

3)How to spread the awareness of this field and increase its outreach in the community.

# IMPLEMENTATION:
1)The process begins by selecting the attributes, in this case the attributes are the most important tools for the type of results we need. 

2)We have used the best possible attributes for predicting a very different kind of result , the result itself aims at giving a brief insight on the players current status , therefore attribute selection is most important. 

3)After finalizing the attributes its time for the second step that is data integration, we combine the different attributes selected above , normalize the attributes and  integrate the entire input data  which consists of all the attributes. 

4)Model selection , model training , model evaluation are the steps which follow by. These are one of the most common steps which are mandatory in any Machine learning model. 

# WORKING:

1)Basic interface displaying an athletes current values(SLEEP,STRESS,TRAINING LOAD,ATL/CTL,BMI) and prediciting whether he is prone to an injury in the near future.

# ANALYSIS:

1)Attribute importance graph, as observed stress plays a very important role

3)Comaparision between injured and not injured player
